Hi! I'm Alexis Coullomb, I work as a post-doc in [Vera Pancaldi's lab](https://www.crct-inserm.fr/21-v-pancaldi/).
I'm interested in network analysis, statistics and machine learning (including deep learning) applied to biology and cancer research more precisely. I use Deep Learning for [Whole Slide Images analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6437786/) and multi-omics data integration, such as [CITE-seq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CITE-Seq) data. This specific website is dedicated to the analyzes for the [seqFISH challenge](https://github.com/BIRSBiointegration/Hackathon/tree/master/seqFISH) for the [BIRS Biointegration workshop](http://www.birs.ca/videos/2020).  

This website is powered by **[fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages)** [^1].
